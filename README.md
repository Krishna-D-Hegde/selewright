# Selewright: A Unified Browser Automation Tool for Test Automation

## üöÄ What is Selewright?

Selewright is a lightweight abstraction layer built on top of **Selenium** and **Playwright**, designed for Browser Test Automation.

## üîç Why Choose Selewright?

### üîÅ Seamless Tool Switching

With Selewright, switching between **Selenium** and **Playwright** becomes seamless ‚Äî *no code changes required* in your test suite.

> Why not stick with any one browser automation tool? [[Read here](https://medium.com/@krishna.d.hegde/selenium-vs-playwright-only-you-can-decide-068a01bb7081)]

### üß† Future-Proof Design

If a new browser automation tool takes over, Selewright can support it, allowing you to adopt it **without reworking your existing codebase**.

### ‚úÇÔ∏è Reduced Boilerplate Code

Selewright includes built-in helper methods for Test Automation to:

- Simplify browser automation tasks
- Fetch/Mock browser APIs using POJOs
- Minimize repetitive code for developers

### ‚è≥ Auto-Wait Mechanism

Selewright brings **Playwright-like auto-waiting to Selenium**, ensuring more stable and reliable test executions.

## üß± Project Structure

- **Selewright**: The core interface for browser automation tools
- **PlaywrightImplementation**: Implements Selewright methods using Playwright
- **SeleniumImplementation**: Implements Selewright methods using Selenium
- **RequestConditionsToMock**: A POJO to define request conditions for mocking browser API calls
- **MockResponseToSend**: A POJO to define responses sent when mocking browser API calls
- **OtherHelpers**: Utility functions for common test automation tasks

### üìö Setup Guide in a Maven Project
- Add Selenium and Playwright dependencies
- Selewright JAR Setup: [Guide Link](https://chatgpt.com/share/68d3ee72-6f90-8001-a11d-210d361dcece)

#### Work in Progress:
- JAR hosted on Maven Central
- Support for other programming languages (Python, JavaScript, C#)
- A Test automation project demonstrating in depth Selewright usage

## üí° Tool Switch Sample Setup

```java
String automationTool = "selenium"; // or "playwright"
Selewright selewright = null;
if (automationTool.equalsIgnoreCase("selenium")) {
    WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
    selewright = new SeleniumImplementation(driver);
} else if (automationTool.equalsIgnoreCase("playwright")){
    Playwright playwright = Playwright.create();
    Browser browser = playwright.chromium().launch(new BrowserType.LaunchOptions().setHeadless(false));
    BrowserContext context = browser.newContext();
    Page page = context.newPage();
    selewright = new PlaywrightImplementation(page);
}
selewright.openUrl("https://www.redbus.in");
```
